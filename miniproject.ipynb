        "We chose Gower’s distance because we assume the survey data will contain a mix of categorical and numeric variables. Gower’s distance is a highly effective measure of distance for mixed data types, since it is designed to measure dissimilarity between observations, whereas other metrics such as Euclidian cannot handle dissimilarity between different data types numerically. The resulting distances in Gower’s are normalized between 0 and 1, which makes it efficient and easy to interpret the results and compare across groups of students. Gower’s method also accounts for differences in scaling by standardizing numeric variables by their range, eliminating the need for extra steps in scaling.\n",

        "The goal with our clusters is to create small, tight-knit clusters of students. As such we chose against single linkage to avoid possible cluster chains which group together lengths of objects rather than what we want. Another issue with single linkage is that it tends to cover a wider area, allowing a wider range of objects in. Centroid linkage on the other hand relies greatly on numeric data to calculate distances which makes it ill suited for our purposes given that the majority of our data will be categorical. Lastly, between average and complete linkage we use complete linkage due to its propensity toward tight clusters. One of our primary concerns is controlling cluster sizes, and while complete linkage is susceptible to outliers, its ability to cluster small groups together give it an edge for our purposes.\n",

        "In complete linkage, we calculate the distance between every single point in every single cluster. Then we find the largest possible distances in between clusters. Then from that list of largest distances, we merge the clusters that have the smallest distance."

A major issue with using this pre-made function is that we cannot guarrentee the sizes of clusters. Some clusters of students can have 5+ students, while other clusters can have 1 student. Due to time constraints, we continue to use these functions and will advise work arounds to ensure proper study group sizes.\n",
