# Problem Overview
Many students struggle with understanding course material, staying accountable, and performing well on exams. While study groups can feel intimidating, research shows they significantly improve comprehension, retention, and exam scores. Now the big question is: How do we create effective study groups that maximize learning, accountability, and confidence while minimizing the fear of participation?


# Data Collection - Fill Out This Form!
First, please fill out our short survey, which we’ll use to recommend everyone’s study groups! While you are all filling that out, we’ll begin talking about the methods used in our hierarchical clustering algorithm. You are all your own cluster to start, but will begin merging together one by one based on similarity and differences in responses!

# Create QR code

qr=qrcode.QRCode(version=None, box_size=8, border=4)
qr.add_data(url)
qr.make(fit=True)
img = qrcode.make(url).convert("RGB") 
#img=qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")
# Display QR code
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

# Gower’s for Distances Between Clusters

# How does our distance work between students?

# Complete Linkage for Merging Clusters
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
Complete linkage describes the metric we use to decide the merging of clusters. In particular, we merge the minimum distance created by the farthest points within two clusters, which is found by comparing the distances from every pair of points between the clusters.

# Feedback from the Evaluation Form
Feedback from the evaluation form will be anonymous, however the results will help us all improve future iterations of our model generalized to all students. ** Ask Rosanna if she wants to share the results to them later on **
